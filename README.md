# Real_Time-Facial-Expression-Detection-System-FER-System-
## Problem Statement
Human Facial Expression are extremly essential in social communication. Normally communication involves both verbal and nonverbal. Nonverbal communication are expressed through facial expression. Face expressions are the delicate signals of the larger communications. Human Facial Expression are important for visually expressing a lot more information. Facial expression recognotion is essential in the field of human-machine interaction. Automated facial recognition systems have many applications, including understanding of human behaviour, dianosing mental disorders and synthetic human expression. Indentifying facial expressions through computers with high detection rates is still a challenging task. In this project we have to use a variety of intensive deep learning techniques to identify the main seven huan emotions : ANGER, SURPRISE, SAD, HAPPY, NEUTRAL.

## System Requirement & Technology Used
- A system with good hardware specification : processor i5 or above, RAM 8GB or above, GPU 1050ti or above (The machine learning step will take so much time)
- IDE (VSCODE, JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, GOOGLE COLLAB)
- Python Libraries and Framework :
  - Keras : High-level neural network API for building and training model.
  - OpenCV(cv2) : Open-source computer version and machine learning software library.
  - Numpy : Library for numerical operation.
- Machine Leaning :
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Learning Architectures

## How It Works

- **Face Detection** : Identify and locate faces within the video stream using computer vision algorithms.
- **Facial Landmark Detection** : Detect facial landmarks such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth to extract relevant features for expression analysis.
- **Expression Classification** : Employ deep learning models to classify facial expressions based on extracted features, differentiating between happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and neutrality.
- **Real-time Feedback** : Upon detection and classification, overlay a bounding box around each detected face and label it with the corresponding expression, providing real-time feedback to the user.

## Conclusion

The Real-Time Facial Expression Detection System marks a significant step in emotion recognition technology. With high accuracy and robustness, it reliably detects and classifies facial expressions, offering valuable insights into emotional states. The deep learning models, trained on extensive datasets, ensure near-accurate results, though they require substantial computational resources and time. This system holds great potential for applications in market research, healthcare, and security, promising to enhance human-computer interaction and emotion understanding in diverse settings.
